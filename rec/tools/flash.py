"""Take the factory backup, then flash. `--force` skips the backup and warns.

The backup step used to be a `depends` entry on the `flash` task. mise runs a
`depends` entry whatever arguments follow the task, so the gate had to move
here to be skippable at all.

`--force` skips TAKING a backup. It never makes a forbidden backup possible:
the forced path does not call `backup_flash` at all, and the unforced path
calls it with no arguments, so nothing a user types reaches the refusal that
stops a provisioned device from copying its WiFi password to this computer.

This tool owns two arguments and forwards the rest to idf.py unchanged, in the
place idf.py wants them. See `split_arguments`.
